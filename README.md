# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game allows two players to play alternately on a 3x3 grid, with logic to determine the winner or a tie.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. The game starts with **Player X**.
3. Players take turns clicking on empty boxes to place their mark (X or O).
4. The game ends when:
   - One player gets three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), or
   - All boxes are filled with no winner (resulting in a tie).
5. Click the "New Game" button to reset the game and play again.

## Game Logic

1. **Winning Conditions**:
   - A player wins by aligning three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
2. **Tie Condition**:
   - If all nine boxes are filled and no player wins, the game declares a tie.
